## Hey there!

I'm **Marcus Wee** — a developer, builder, and curious mind. I like working on projects that sit at the intersection of technology and creativity, whether that's writing code, exploring new frameworks, or tinkering with ideas.

This blog is my space to share what I'm learning, what I'm building, and the occasional thought that doesn't fit into a commit message.

## What I do

- Build software and side projects
- Explore new technologies and frameworks
- Write about things I find interesting

## Get in touch

- **GitHub:** [Marcushadow](https://github.com/Marcushadow)

Feel free to reach out — I'm always happy to connect with fellow builders and learners.
