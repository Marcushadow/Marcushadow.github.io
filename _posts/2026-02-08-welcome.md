Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm Marcus, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on tech, code, projects, and whatever else catches my attention. I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and here we are.

## Why a blog?

A few reasons:

- **Learning in public** — writing about what I'm working on forces me to understand it better. If I can explain something clearly, I probably actually know it.
- **A record of progress** — it's easy to forget how far you've come. Having a trail of posts is a nice way to look back.
- **Sharing is caring** — if something I write helps even one person solve a problem or learn something new, that's a win.

## What to expect

I'll mostly write about:

- **Tech and programming** — tools, languages, frameworks, and things I'm building
- **Projects** — walkthroughs of things I'm working on
- **Random thoughts** — the occasional non-technical post when something's on my mind

## Let's go

This is just the beginning. If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. Stick around — there's more to come.
